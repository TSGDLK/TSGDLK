<p>Moscow's stated objectives of crushing the Ukrainian military and ousting <br>
    the pro-West elected government of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy remained out of reach, <br>
    with Zelenskiy unshaken and Western military aid pouring across the Polish and Romanian borders. <br>
    The UK Defence Ministry said on Thursday that a large Russian column northwest of Kyiv had made little progress in over a week and was suffering continued losses. <br>
    It added that as casualties mount, Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to draw from across the armed forces to replace the losses.</p>
    <br>
    Zelenskiy accused Russia of carrying out "genocide" after Ukrainian officials said Russian aircraft bombed a children's <br>
    hospital on Wednesday, burying patients in rubble despite a ceasefire deal for people to flee Mariupol.<br>
    "What kind of country is this, the Russian Federation, which is afraid of hospitals, is afraid of maternity hospitals, <br>
    and destroys them?" Zelenskiy said in a televised address late on Wednesday.<br>
    The attack, which authorities said injured women in labour and left children in the wreckage, underscored U.S.warnings <br>
    that the biggest assault on a European state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after Russia's early failures.<br>
    <br>
    The World Bank's chief economist said Moscow was edging close to defaulting on its debt. <br>
